     * This makes an explicit destroy impractical as it can't be enforced on static runners, and
     * wouldn't actually destroy the runner before native initialization as that would cause tasks
     * to be lost. A finalizer could give us the correct behaviour here, but finalizers are banned
     * due to the performance cost they impose, and all of the many correctness gotchas around
     * implementing a finalizer.
     *
     * The strategy we've gone with here is to use a ReferenceQueue to keep track of which
     * TaskRunners are no longer reachable (and may have been GC'd), and to delete the native
     * counterpart for those TaskRunners by polling the queue when doing non-performance-critical
     * operations on TaskRunners, like creating a new one. In order to prevent this TaskRunner from
     * being GC'd before its tasks can be posted to the native runner, PostTask holds a strong
