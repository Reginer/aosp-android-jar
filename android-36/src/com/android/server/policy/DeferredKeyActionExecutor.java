     * Queue a key action which can be triggered at a later time. Note that this method will also

     *
     * <p>Warning: the queued actions will only be cleaned up lazily when a new gesture downTime is
     * recorded. If no new gesture downTime is recorded and the existing gesture is not executable,
     * the actions will be kept in the buffer indefinitely. This may cause memory leak if the action
     * itself holds references to temporary objects, or if too many actions are queued for the same
     * gesture. The risk scales as you track more key codes. Please use this method with caution and
     * ensure you only queue small amount of actions with limited size.
     *
     * <p>If you need to queue a large amount of actions with large size, there are several
     * potential solutions to relief the memory leak risks:
     *
     * <p>1. Add a timeout (e.g. ANR timeout) based clean-up mechanism.
     *
     * <p>2. Clean-up queued actions when we know they won't be needed. E.g., add a callback when
     * the gesture is handled by apps, and clean up queued actions associated with the handled
     * gesture.
     *
     * @param keyCode the key code which triggers the action.
     * @param downTime the down time of the key gesture. For multi-press actions, this is the down
     *     time of the last press. For long-press or very long-press actions, this is the initial
     *     down time.
     * @param action the action that will be triggered at a later time.
