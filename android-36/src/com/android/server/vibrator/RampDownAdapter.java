/**
 * Adapter that applies the ramp down duration config to bring down the vibrator amplitude smoothly.
 *
 * <p>This prevents the device from ringing when it cannot handle abrupt changes between ON and OFF
 * states. This will not change other types of abrupt amplitude changes in the original effect. The
 * effect overall duration is preserved by this transformation.
 *
 * <p>Waveforms with ON/OFF segments are handled gracefully by the ramp down changes. Each OFF
 * segment preceded by an ON segment will be shortened, and a ramp or step down will be added to the
 * transition between ON and OFF. The ramps/steps can be shorter than the configured duration in
 * order to preserve the waveform  timings, but they will still soften the ringing effect.
 *
 * <p>If the segment preceding an OFF segment a {@link RampSegment} then a new ramp segment will be
 * added to bring the amplitude down. If it is a {@link StepSegment} then a sequence of steps will
 * be used to bring the amplitude down to zero. This ensures that the transition from the last
 * amplitude to zero will be handled by the same vibrate method.
