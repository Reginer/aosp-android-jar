/**
 * @hide
 * @deprecated in API 16
 * <p>The RenderScript fragment program, also known as fragment shader is responsible
 * for manipulating pixel data in a user defined way. It's constructed from a GLSL
 * shader string containing the program body, textures inputs, and a Type object
 * that describes the constants used by the program. Similar to the vertex programs,
 * when an allocation with constant input values is bound to the shader, its values
 * are sent to the graphics program automatically.</p>
 * <p> The values inside the allocation are not explicitly tracked. If they change between two draw
 * calls using the same program object, the runtime needs to be notified of that
 * change by calling rsgAllocationSyncAll so it could send the new values to hardware.
 * Communication between the vertex and fragment programs is handled internally in the
 * GLSL code. For example, if the fragment program is expecting a varying input called
 * varTex0, the GLSL code inside the program vertex must provide it.
 * </p>
