/**
 * A class to encapsulate information about an audio focus request.
 * An {@code AudioFocusRequest} instance is built by {@link Builder}, and is used to
 * request and abandon audio focus, respectively
 * with {@link AudioManager#requestAudioFocus(AudioFocusRequest)} and
 * {@link AudioManager#abandonAudioFocusRequest(AudioFocusRequest)}.
 *
 * <h3>What is audio focus?</h3>
 * <p>Audio focus is a concept introduced in API 8. It is used to convey the fact that a user can
 * only focus on a single audio stream at a time, e.g. listening to music or a podcast, but not
 * both at the same time. In some cases, multiple audio streams can be playing at the same time,
 * but there is only one the user would really listen to (focus on), while the other plays in
 * the background. An example of this is driving directions being spoken while music plays at
 * a reduced volume (a.k.a. ducking).
 * <p>When an application requests audio focus, it expresses its intention to "own" audio focus to
 * play audio. Let's review the different types of focus requests, the return value after a request,
 * and the responses to a loss.
 * <p class="note">Note: applications should not play anything until granted focus.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The different types of focus requests</h3>
 * <p>There are four focus request types. A successful focus request with each will yield different
 * behaviors by the system and the other application that previously held audio focus.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN} expresses the fact that your application is now the
 * sole source of audio that the user is listening to. The duration of the audio playback is
 * unknown, and is possibly very long: after the user finishes interacting with your application,
 * (s)he doesn't expect another audio stream to resume. Examples of uses of this focus gain are
 * for music playback, for a game or a video player.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT} is for a situation when you know your
 * application is temporarily grabbing focus from the current owner, but the user expects playback
 * to go back to where it was once your application no longer requires audio focus. An example is
 * for playing an alarm, or during a VoIP call. The playback is known to be finite: the alarm will
 * time-out or be dismissed, the VoIP call has a beginning and an end. When any of those events
 * ends, and if the user was listening to music when it started, the user expects music to resume,
 * but didn't wish to listen to both at the same time.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK}: this focus request type is similar
 * to {@code AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT} for the temporary aspect of the focus request, but it also
 * expresses the fact during the time you own focus, you allow another application to keep playing
 * at a reduced volume, "ducked". Examples are when playing driving directions or notifications,
 * it's ok for music to keep playing, but not loud enough that it would prevent the directions to
 * be hard to understand. A typical attenuation by the "ducked" application is a factor of 0.2f
 * (or -14dB), that can for instance be applied with {@code MediaPlayer.setVolume(0.2f)} when
 * using this class for playback.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_EXCLUSIVE} is also for a temporary request,
 * but also expresses that your application expects the device to not play anything else. This is
 * typically used if you are doing audio recording or speech recognition, and don't want for
 * examples notifications to be played by the system during that time.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>An {@code AudioFocusRequest} instance always contains one of the four types of requests
 * explained above. It is passed when building an {@code AudioFocusRequest} instance with its
 * builder in the {@link Builder} constructor
 * {@link AudioFocusRequest.Builder#Builder(int)}, or
 * with {@link AudioFocusRequest.Builder#setFocusGain(int)} after copying an existing instance with
 * {@link AudioFocusRequest.Builder#Builder(AudioFocusRequest)}.
 *
 * <h3>Qualifying your focus request</h3>
 * <h4>Use case requiring a focus request</h4>
 * <p>Any focus request is qualified by the {@link AudioAttributes}
 * (see {@link Builder#setAudioAttributes(AudioAttributes)}) that describe the audio use case that
 * will follow the request (once it's successful or granted). It is recommended to use the
 * same {@code AudioAttributes} for the request as the attributes you are using for audio/media
 * playback.
 * <br>If no attributes are set, default attributes of {@link AudioAttributes#USAGE_MEDIA} are used.
 *
 * <h4>Delayed focus</h4>
 * <p>Audio focus can be "locked" by the system for a number of reasons: during a phone call, when
 * the car to which the device is connected plays an emergency message... To support these
 * situations, the application can request to be notified when its request is fulfilled, by flagging
 * its request as accepting delayed focus, with {@link Builder#setAcceptsDelayedFocusGain(boolean)}.
 * <br>If focus is requested while being locked by the system,
 * {@link AudioManager#requestAudioFocus(AudioFocusRequest)} will return
 * {@link AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_DELAYED}. When focus isn't locked anymore, the focus
 * listener set with {@link Builder#setOnAudioFocusChangeListener(OnAudioFocusChangeListener)}
 * or with {@link Builder#setOnAudioFocusChangeListener(OnAudioFocusChangeListener, Handler)} will
 * be called to notify the application it now owns audio focus.
 *
 * <h4>Pausing vs ducking</h4>
 * <p>When an application requested audio focus with
 * {@link AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK}, the system will duck the current focus
 * owner.
 * <p class="note">Note: this behavior is <b>new for Android O</b>, whereas applications targeting
 * SDK level up to API 25 had to implement the ducking themselves when they received a focus
 * loss of {@link AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK}.
 * <p>But ducking is not always the behavior expected by the user. A typical example is when the
 * device plays driving directions while the user is listening to an audio book or podcast, and
 * expects the audio playback to pause, instead of duck, as it is hard to understand a navigation
 * prompt and spoken content at the same time. Therefore the system will not automatically duck
 * when it detects it would be ducking spoken content: such content is detected when the
 * {@code AudioAttributes} of the player are qualified by
 * {@link AudioAttributes#CONTENT_TYPE_SPEECH}. Refer for instance to
 * {@link AudioAttributes.Builder#setContentType(int)} and
 * {@link MediaPlayer#setAudioAttributes(AudioAttributes)} if you are writing a media playback
 * application for audio book, podcasts... Since the system will not automatically duck applications
 * that play speech, it calls their focus listener instead to notify them of
 * {@link AudioManager#AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK}, so they can pause instead. Note that
 * this behavior is independent of the use of {@code AudioFocusRequest}, but tied to the use
 * of {@code AudioAttributes}.
 * <p>If your application requires pausing instead of ducking for any other reason than playing
 * speech, you can also declare so with {@link Builder#setWillPauseWhenDucked(boolean)}, which will
 * cause the system to call your focus listener instead of automatically ducking.
 *
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * <p>The example below covers the following steps to be found in any application that would play
 * audio, and use audio focus. Here we play an audio book, and our application is intended to pause
 * rather than duck when it loses focus. These steps consist in:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Creating {@code AudioAttributes} to be used for the playback and the focus request.</li>
 * <li>Configuring and creating the {@code AudioFocusRequest} instance that defines the intended
 *     focus behaviors.</li>
 * <li>Requesting audio focus and checking the return code to see if playback can happen right
 *     away, or is delayed.</li>
 * <li>Implementing a focus change listener to respond to focus gains and losses.</li>
 * </ul>
