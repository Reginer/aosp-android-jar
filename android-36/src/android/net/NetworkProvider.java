     * A NetworkProvider's role is to provide networks. This method is how a provider tells the
     * connectivity stack what kind of network it may provide. The score and caps arguments act
     * as filters that the connectivity stack uses to tell when the offer is valuable. When an
     * offer might be preferred over existing networks, the provider will receive a call to
     * the associated callback's {@link NetworkOfferCallback#onNetworkNeeded} method. The provider
     * should then try to bring up this network. When an offer is no longer useful, the stack
     * will inform the provider by calling {@link NetworkOfferCallback#onNetworkUnneeded}. The
     * provider should stop trying to bring up such a network, or disconnect it if it already has
     * one.
     *
     * The stack determines what offers are valuable according to what networks are currently
     * available to the system, and what networking requests are made by applications. If an
     * offer looks like it could connect a better network than any existing network for any
     * particular request, that's when the stack decides the network is needed. If the current
     * networking requests are all satisfied by networks that this offer couldn't possibly be a
     * better match for, that's when the offer is no longer valuable. An offer starts out as
     * unneededÂ ; the provider should not try to bring up the network until
     * {@link NetworkOfferCallback#onNetworkNeeded} is called.
     *
     * Note that the offers are non-binding to the providers, in particular because providers
     * often don't know if they will be able to bring up such a network at any given time. For
     * example, no wireless network may be in range when the offer would be valuable. This is fine
     * and expectedÂ ; the provider should simply continue to try to bring up the network and do so
     * if/when it becomes possible. In the mean time, the stack will continue to satisfy requests
     * with the best network currently available, or if none, keep the apps informed that no
     * network can currently satisfy this request. When/if the provider can bring up the network,
     * the connectivity stack will match it against requests, and inform interested apps of the
     * availability of this network. This may, in turn, render the offer of some other provider
     * low-value if all requests it used to satisfy are now better served by this network.
     *
     * A network can become unneeded for a reason like the aboveÂ : whether the provider managed
     * to bring up the offered network after it became needed or not, some other provider may
     * bring up a better network than this one, making this network unneeded. A network may also
     * become unneeded if the application making the request withdrew it (for example, after it
     * is done transferring data, or if the user canceled an operation).
     *
     * The capabilities and score act as filters as to what requests the provider will see.
     * They are not promises, but for best performance, the providers should strive to put
     * as much known information as possible in the offer. For the score, it should put as
     * strong a score as the networks will have, since this will filter what requests the
     * provider sees â it's not a promise, it only serves to avoid sending requests that
     * the provider can't ever hope to satisfy better than any current network. For capabilities,
     * it should put all NetworkAgent-managed capabilities a network may have, even if it doesn't
     * have them at first. This applies to INTERNET, for exampleÂ ; if a provider thinks the
     * network it can bring up for this offer may offer Internet access it should include the
     * INTERNET bit. It's fine if the brought up network ends up not actually having INTERNET.
     *
     * TODO : in the future, to avoid possible infinite loops, there should be constraints on
     * what can be put in capabilities of networks brought up for an offer. If a provider might
     * bring up a network with or without INTERNET, then it should file two offersÂ : this will
     * let it know precisely what networks are needed, so it can avoid bringing up networks that
     * won't actually satisfy requests and remove the risk for bring-up-bring-down loops.
