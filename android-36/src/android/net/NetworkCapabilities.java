/**
 * Representation of the capabilities of an active network.
 *
 * <p>@see <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/reading-network-state>
 * this general guide</a> on how to use NetworkCapabilities and related classes.
 *
 * <p>NetworkCapabilities represent what a network can do and what its
 * characteristics are like. The principal attribute of NetworkCapabilities
 * is in the capabilities bits, which are checked with
 * {@link #hasCapability(int)}. See the list of capabilities and each
 * capability for a description of what it means.
 *
 * <p>Some prime examples include {@code NET_CAPABILITY_MMS}, which means that the
 * network is capable of sending MMS. A network without this capability
 * is not capable of sending MMS.
 * <p>The {@code NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET} capability means that the network is
 * configured to reach the general Internet. It may or may not actually
 * provide connectivity ; the {@code NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED} bit indicates that
 * the system found actual connectivity to the general Internet the last
 * time it checked. Apps interested in actual connectivity should usually
 * look at both these capabilities.
 * <p>The {@code NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_METERED} capability is set for networks that
 * do not bill the user for consumption of bytes. Applications are
 * encouraged to consult this to determine appropriate usage, and to
 * limit usage of metered network where possible, including deferring
 * big downloads until such a time that an unmetered network is connected.
 * Also see {@link android.app.job.JobScheduler} to help with scheduling such
 * downloads, in particular
 * {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setRequiredNetwork(NetworkRequest)}.
 * <p>NetworkCapabilities contain a number of other capabilities that
 * represent what modern networks can and can't do. Look up the individual
 * capabilities in this class to learn about each of them.
 *
 * <p>NetworkCapabilities typically represent attributes that can apply to
 * any network. The attributes that apply only to specific transports like
 * cellular or Wi-Fi can be found in the specifier (for requestable attributes)
 * or in the transport info (for non-requestable ones). See
 * {@link #getNetworkSpecifier} and {@link #getTransportInfo}. An app would
 * downcast these to the specific class for the transport they need if they
 * are interested in transport-specific attributes. Also see
 * {@link android.net.wifi.WifiNetworkSpecifier} or
 * {@link android.net.wifi.WifiInfo} for some examples of each of these.
 *
 * <p>NetworkCapabilities also contains other attributes like the estimated
 * upstream and downstream bandwidth and the specific transport of that
 * network (e.g. {@link #TRANSPORT_CELLULAR}). Generally, apps should normally
 * have little reason to check for the type of transport ; for example, to
 * query whether a network costs money to the user, do not look at the
 * transport, but instead look at the absence or presence of
 * {@link #NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_METERED} which will correctly account for
 * metered Wi-Fis and free of charge cell connections.
 *
 * <p>The system communicates with apps about connected networks and uses
 * NetworkCapabilities to express these capabilities about these networks.
 * Apps should register callbacks with the {@link ConnectivityManager#requestNetwork}
 * or {@link ConnectivityManager#registerNetworkCallback} family of methods
 * to learn about the capabilities of a network on a continuous basis
 * and be able to react to changes to capabilities. For quick debugging Android also
 * provides {@link ConnectivityManager#getNetworkCapabilities(Network)},
 * but the dynamic nature of networking makes this ill-suited to production
 * code since capabilities obtained in this way can go stale immediately.
 *
 * <p>Also see {@link NetworkRequest} which uses the same capabilities
 * together with {@link ConnectivityManager#requestNetwork} for how to
 * request the system brings up the kind of network your application needs.

     * of this API expect in practice. A network that must match all UIDs can still be
     * expressed with a set ranging the entire set of possible UIDs.
     * <p>
     * mUids is typically (and at this time, only) used by VPN. This network is only available to
     * the UIDs in this list, and it is their default network. Apps in this list that wish to
     * bypass the VPN can do so iff the VPN app allows them to or if they are privileged. If this
     * member is null, then the network is not restricted by app UID. If it's an empty list, then
     * it means nobody can use it.
     * As a special exception, the app managing this network (as identified by its UID stored in
     * mOwnerUid) can always see this network. This is embodied by a special check in
     * satisfiedByUids. That still does not mean the network necessarily <strong>applies</strong>
     * to the app that manages it as determined by #appliesToUid.
     * <p>
     * Please note that in principle a single app can be associated with multiple UIDs because
     * each app will have a different UID when it's run as a different (macro-)user. A single
     * macro user can only have a single active VPN app at any given time however.
     * <p>
     * Also please be aware this class does not try to enforce any normalization on this. Callers
     * can only alter the UIDs by setting them wholesale : this class does not provide any utility
     * to add or remove individual UIDs or ranges. If callers have any normalization needs on
     * their own (like requiring sortedness or no overlap) they need to enforce it
