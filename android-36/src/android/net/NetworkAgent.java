/**
 * A utility class for handling for communicating between bearer-specific
 * code and ConnectivityService.
 *
 * An agent manages the life cycle of a network. A network starts its
 * life cycle when {@link register} is called on NetworkAgent. The network
 * is then connecting. When full L3 connectivity has been established,
 * the agent should call {@link markConnected} to inform the system that
 * this network is ready to use. When the network disconnects its life
 * ends and the agent should call {@link unregister}, at which point the
 * system will clean up and free resources.
 * Any reconnection becomes a new logical network, so after a network
 * is disconnected the agent cannot be used any more. Network providers
 * should create a new NetworkAgent instance to handle new connections.
 *
 * A bearer may have more than one NetworkAgent if it can simultaneously
 * support separate networks (IMS / Internet / MMS Apns on cellular, or
 * perhaps connections with different SSID or P2P for Wi-Fi).
 *
 * This class supports methods to start and stop sending keepalive packets.
 * Keepalive packets are typically sent at periodic intervals over a network
 * with NAT when there is no other traffic to avoid the network forcefully
 * closing the connection. NetworkAgents that manage technologies that
 * have hardware support for keepalive should implement the related
 * methods to save battery life. NetworkAgent that cannot get support
 * without waking up the CPU should not, as this would be prohibitive in
 * terms of battery - these agents should simply not override the related
 * methods, which results in the implementation returning
 * {@link SocketKeepalive.ERROR_UNSUPPORTED} as appropriate.
 *
 * Keepalive packets need to be sent at relatively frequent intervals
 * (a few seconds to a few minutes). As the contents of keepalive packets
 * depend on the current network status, hardware needs to be configured
 * to send them and has a limited amount of memory to do so. The HAL
 * formalizes this as slots that an implementation can configure to send
 * the correct packets. Devices typically have a small number of slots
 * per radio technology, and the specific number of slots for each
 * technology is specified in configuration files.
 * See {@link SocketKeepalive} for details.
