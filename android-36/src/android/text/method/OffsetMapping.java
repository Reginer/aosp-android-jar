     * advances at the original text, the offset at the transformed text must advance or stay there.
     * <br/>
     *
     * Depending on the mapping strategy, a same offset can be mapped differently. For example,
     * <pre>
     * Original:       ABCDE
     * Transformed:    ABCXDE ('X' is introduced due to the transformation.)
     * </pre>
     * Let's check the offset 3, which is the offset of the character 'D'.
     * If we want to map the character offset 3, it should be mapped to index 4.
     * If we want to map the cursor offset 3 (the offset of the character before which the cursor is
     * placed), it's unclear if the mapped cursor is before 'X' or after 'X'.
     * This depends on how the transformed text reacts an insertion at offset 3 in the original
     * text. Assume character 'V' is insert at offset 3 in the original text, and the original text
     * become "ABCVDE". The transformed text can be:
     * <pre>
     * 1) "ABCVXDE"
     * or
     * 2) "ABCXVDE"
     * </pre>
     * In the first case, the offset 3 should be mapped to 3 (before 'X'). And in the second case,
     * the offset should be mapped to 4 (after 'X').<br/>
     *
     * In some cases, a character offset at the original text doesn't have a proper corresponding
     * offset at the transformed text. For example:
     * <pre>
     * Original:    ABCDE
     * Transformed: ABDE ('C' is deleted due to the transformation.)
     * </pre>
     * The character offset 2 can be mapped either to offset 2 or 3, but neither is meaningful. For
     * convenience, it MUST map to the next offset (offset 3 in this case), or the
     * transformedText.length() if there is no valid character to map.
     * This is mandatory when the map strategy is {@link #MAP_STRATEGY_CHARACTER}, but doesn't
     * apply for other map strategies.
     *
     * @param offset the offset at the original text. It's normally equal to or less than the
     *               originalText.length(). When {@link #MAP_STRATEGY_CHARACTER} is passed, it must
     *               be less than originalText.length(). For convenience, it's also allowed to be
     *               negative, which represents an invalid offset. When the given offset is
     *               negative, this method should return it as it is.
     * @param strategy the mapping strategy. Depending on its value, the same offset can be mapped
     *                 differently.
     * @return the mapped offset at the transformed text, must be equal to or less than the
