/**
 * The set of emoji that should be drawn by the system with the default font for device consistency.
 *
 * This is intended to be used only by applications that do custom emoji rendering using tools like
 * {@link android.text.style.ReplacementSpan} or custom emoji fonts.
 *
 * An example of how this should be used:
 *
 * <p>
 *     <ol>
 *         <li>
 *             Match emoji for third party custom rendering
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             For each match, check against NonStandardEmoji before displaying custom glyph
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             If in NonStandardEmojiSet, do not display custom glyph (render with
 *             android.graphics.Typeface.DEFAULT instead)
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             Otherwise, do custom rendering like normal
 *         </li>
 *     </ol>
