/**
 * A configured capture session for a {@link CameraDevice}, used for capturing images from the
 * camera or reprocessing images captured from the camera in the same session previously.
 *
 * <p>A CameraCaptureSession is created by providing a set of target output surfaces to
 * {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession createCaptureSession}, or by providing an
 * {@link android.hardware.camera2.params.InputConfiguration} and a set of target output surfaces to
 * {@link CameraDevice#createReprocessableCaptureSession createReprocessableCaptureSession} for a
 * reprocessable capture session. Once created, the session is active until a new session is
 * created by the camera device, or the camera device is closed.</p>
 *
 * <p>All capture sessions can be used for capturing images from the camera but only reprocessable
 * capture sessions can reprocess images captured from the camera in the same session previously.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Creating a session is an expensive operation and can take several hundred milliseconds, since
 * it requires configuring the camera device's internal pipelines and allocating memory buffers for
 * sending images to the desired targets. Therefore the setup is done asynchronously, and
 * {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSession createCaptureSession} and
 * {@link CameraDevice#createReprocessableCaptureSession createReprocessableCaptureSession} will
 * send the ready-to-use CameraCaptureSession to the provided listener's
 * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigured onConfigured} callback. If configuration
 * cannot be completed, then the
 * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigureFailed onConfigureFailed} is called, and the
 * session will not become active.</p>
 *<!--
 * <p>Any capture requests (repeating or non-repeating) submitted before the session is ready will
 * be queued up and will begin capture once the session becomes ready. In case the session cannot be
 * configured and {@link StateCallback#onConfigureFailed onConfigureFailed} is called, all queued
 * capture requests are discarded.</p>
 *-->
 * <p>If a new session is created by the camera device, then the previous session is closed, and its
 * associated {@link StateCallback#onClosed onClosed} callback will be invoked.  All
 * of the session methods will throw an IllegalStateException if called once the session is
 * closed.</p>
 *
 * <p>A closed session clears any repeating requests (as if {@link #stopRepeating} had been called),
 * but will still complete all of its in-progress capture requests as normal, before a newly
 * created session takes over and reconfigures the camera device.</p>

     * <p>Pre-allocate all buffers for an output Surface.</p>
     *
     * <p>Normally, the image buffers for a given output Surface are allocated on-demand,
     * to minimize startup latency and memory overhead.</p>
     *
     * <p>However, in some cases, it may be desirable for the buffers to be allocated before
     * any requests targeting the Surface are actually submitted to the device. Large buffers
     * may take some time to allocate, which can result in delays in submitting requests until
     * sufficient buffers are allocated to reach steady-state behavior. Such delays can cause
     * bursts to take longer than desired, or cause skips or stutters in preview output.</p>
     *
     * <p>The prepare() method can be used to perform this preallocation. It may only be called for
     * a given output Surface before that Surface is used as a target for a request. The number of
     * buffers allocated is the sum of the count needed by the consumer providing the output
     * Surface, and the maximum number needed by the camera device to fill its pipeline. Since this
     * may be a larger number than what is actually required for steady-state operation, using
     * prepare may result in higher memory consumption than the normal on-demand behavior results
     * in. Prepare() will also delay the time to first output to a given Surface, in exchange for
     * smoother frame rate once the allocation is complete.</p>
     *
     * <p>For example, an application that creates an
     * {@link android.media.ImageReader#newInstance ImageReader} with a maxImages argument of 10,
     * but only uses 3 simultaneous Images at once would normally only cause those 3 images to be
     * allocated (plus what is needed by the camera device for smooth operation).  But using
     * prepare() on the ImageReader Surface will result in all 10 Images being allocated. So
     * applications using this method should take care to request only the number of buffers
     * actually necessary for their application.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the same output Surface is used in consecutive sessions (without closing the first
     * session explicitly), then its already-allocated buffers are carried over, and if it was
     * used as a target of a capture request in the first session, prepare cannot be called on it
     * in the second session.</p>
     *
     * <p>Once allocation is complete, {@link StateCallback#onSurfacePrepared} will be invoked with
     * the Surface provided to this method. Between the prepare call and the onSurfacePrepared call,
     * the Surface provided to prepare must not be used as a target of a CaptureRequest submitted
     * to this session.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that if 2 surfaces share the same stream via {@link
     * OutputConfiguration#enableSurfaceSharing} and {@link OutputConfiguration#addSurface},
     * prepare() only needs to be called on one surface, and {@link
     * StateCallback#onSurfacePrepared} will be triggered for both surfaces.</p>
     *
     * <p>{@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCharacteristics#INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL_LEGACY LEGACY}

     * {@link StateCallback#onSurfacePrepared} will be immediately called, and no preallocation is
     * done.</p>
