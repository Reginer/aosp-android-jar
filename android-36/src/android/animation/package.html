These classes provide functionality for the property animation system, which allows you 
to animate object properties of any type. <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, and hexadecimal
color values are supported by default. You can animate any other type by telling the system how
to calculate the values for that given type with a custom {@link android.animation.TypeEvaluator}.

You can set many different types of interpolators (contained in {@link android.view.animation}),
specify {@link android.animation.Keyframe keyframes}, or group animations to play sequentially
or simultaneously (with {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet}) to further control your animation
behaviors.</p>
