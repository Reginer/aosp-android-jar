/**
 * P-Called-Party-ID header - Private Header: RFC 3455.
 * <p>A proxy server inserts a P-Called-Party-ID header, typically in an INVITE request,
 * en-route to its destination. The header is populated with the Request-URI received
 * by the proxy in the request. </p>
 * <p>Both the business SIP URI and the personal SIP URI are registered in the SIP registrar,
 * so both URIs can receive invitations to new sessions. When the user receives an invitation
 * to join a session, he/she should be aware of which of the several registered SIP URIs this
 * session was sent to. </p>
