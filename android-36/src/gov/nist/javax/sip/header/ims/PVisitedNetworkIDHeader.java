/**
 * P-Visited-Network-ID SIP Private Header: RFC 3455.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * . One of the conditions for a home network to accept the registration of a UA roaming to a
 * particular visited network, is the existence of a roaming agreement between the home and
 * the visited network. There is a need to indicate to the home network which one is the visited
 * network that is providing services to the roaming UA.
 * <li>
 * . user agents always register to the home network. The REGISTER request is proxied by
 * one or more proxies located in the visited network towards the home network
 * <li>
 * . the visited network includes an identification that is known at the home network
 * <li>
 * . This identification should be globally unique, and takes the form of a quoted text string or a token
 * <li>
 * . In case a REGISTER or other request is traversing different administrative domains
 * (e.g., different visited networks), a SIP proxy MAY insert a NEW P-Visited-Network-ID header
 * if the request does not contain a P-Visited-Network-ID header with the same network
 * identifier as its own network identifier
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Sintax: </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * P-Visited-Network-ID = "P-Visited-Network-ID" HCOLON
 *                         vnetwork-spec
 *                         *(COMMA vnetwork-spec)
 * vnetwork-spec        = (token / quoted-string)
 *                         *(SEMI vnetwork-param)
 * vnetwork-param       = generic-param
 *
 *
 * eg: P-Visited-Network-ID: other.net, "Visited network number 1"
