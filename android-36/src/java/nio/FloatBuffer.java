/**
 * A float buffer.
 *
 * <p> This class defines four categories of operations upon
 * float buffers:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li><p> Absolute and relative {@link #get() <i>get</i>} and
 *   {@link #put(float) <i>put</i>} methods that read and write
 *   single floats; </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Absolute and relative {@link #get(float[]) <i>bulk get</i>}
 *   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of floats from this buffer
 *   into an array; and</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Absolute and relative {@link #put(float[]) <i>bulk put</i>}
 *   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of floats from a
 *   float array or some other float
 *   buffer into this buffer; and </p></li>
 *












 *
 *   <li><p> A method for {@link #compact compacting}
 *   a float buffer.  </p></li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> Float buffers can be created either by {@link #allocate
 * <i>allocation</i>}, which allocates space for the buffer's
 *






 *
 * content, by {@link #wrap(float[]) <i>wrapping</i>} an existing
 * float array  into a buffer, or by creating a
 * <a href="ByteBuffer.html#views"><i>view</i></a> of an existing byte buffer.
 *

 *


































































































*

 *
 * <p> Like a byte buffer, a float buffer is either <a
 * href="ByteBuffer.html#direct"><i>direct</i> or <i>non-direct</i></a>.  A
 * float buffer created via the {@code wrap} methods of this class will
 * be non-direct.  A float buffer created as a view of a byte buffer will
 * be direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not
 * a float buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the {@link
 * #isDirect isDirect} method.  </p>
 *

*










 *



 *
 * <p> Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
 * specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows
 * method invocations to be chained.
 *
