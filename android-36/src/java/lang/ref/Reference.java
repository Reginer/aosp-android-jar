     * reclaimable by garbage collection at least until after the invocation of
     * this method.  Invocation of this method does not itself initiate garbage
     * collection or finalization.
     *
     * <p> This method establishes an ordering for
     * <a href="package-summary.html#reachability"><em>strong reachability</em></a>
     * with respect to garbage collection.  It controls relations that are
     * otherwise only implicit in a program -- the reachability conditions
     * triggering garbage collection.  This method is designed for use in
     * uncommon situations of premature finalization where using
     * {@code synchronized} blocks or methods, or using other synchronization
     * facilities are not possible or do not provide the desired control.  This
     * method is applicable only when reclamation may have visible effects,
     * which is possible for objects with finalizers (See
     * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.6">
     * Section 12.6 17 of <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite></a>)
     * that are implemented in ways that rely on ordering control for correctness.
     *
     * @apiNote
     * Finalization may occur whenever the virtual machine detects that no
     * reference to an object will ever be stored in the heap: The garbage
     * collector may reclaim an object even if the fields of that object are
     * still in use, so long as the object has otherwise become unreachable.
     * This may have surprising and undesirable effects in cases such as the
     * following example in which the bookkeeping associated with a class is
     * managed through array indices.  Here, method {@code action} uses a
     * {@code reachabilityFence} to ensure that the {@code Resource} object is
     * not reclaimed before bookkeeping on an associated
     * {@code ExternalResource} has been performed; in particular here, to
     * ensure that the array slot holding the {@code ExternalResource} is not
     * nulled out in method {@link Object#finalize}, which may otherwise run
     * concurrently.
     *
     * <pre> {@code
     * class Resource {
     *   private static ExternalResource[] externalResourceArray = ...
     *
     *   int myIndex;
     *   Resource(...) {
     *     myIndex = ...
     *     externalResourceArray[myIndex] = ...;
     *     ...
     *   }
     *   protected void finalize() {
     *     externalResourceArray[myIndex] = null;
     *     ...
     *   }
     *   public void action() {
     *     try {
     *       // ...
     *       int i = myIndex;
     *       Resource.update(externalResourceArray[i]);
     *     } finally {
     *       Reference.reachabilityFence(this);
     *     }
     *   }
     *   private static void update(ExternalResource ext) {
     *     ext.status = ...;
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * Here, the invocation of {@code reachabilityFence} is nonintuitively
     * placed <em>after</em> the call to {@code update}, to ensure that the
     * array slot is not nulled out by {@link Object#finalize} before the
     * update, even if the call to {@code action} was the last use of this
     * object.  This might be the case if, for example a usage in a user program
     * had the form {@code new Resource().action();} which retains no other
     * reference to this {@code Resource}.  While probably overkill here,
     * {@code reachabilityFence} is placed in a {@code finally} block to ensure
     * that it is invoked across all paths in the method.  In a method with more
     * complex control paths, you might need further precautions to ensure that
     * {@code reachabilityFence} is encountered along all of them.
     *
     * <p> It is sometimes possible to better encapsulate use of
     * {@code reachabilityFence}.  Continuing the above example, if it were
     * acceptable for the call to method {@code update} to proceed even if the
     * finalizer had already executed (nulling out slot), then you could
     * localize use of {@code reachabilityFence}:
     *
     * <pre> {@code
     * public void action2() {
     *   // ...
     *   Resource.update(getExternalResource());
     * }
     * private ExternalResource getExternalResource() {
     *   ExternalResource ext = externalResourceArray[myIndex];
     *   Reference.reachabilityFence(this);
     *   return ext;
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p> Method {@code reachabilityFence} is not required in constructions
     * that themselves ensure reachability.  For example, because objects that
     * are locked cannot, in general, be reclaimed, it would suffice if all
     * accesses of the object, in all methods of class {@code Resource}
     * (including {@code finalize}) were enclosed in {@code synchronized (this)}
     * blocks.  (Further, such blocks must not include infinite loops, or
     * themselves be unreachable, which fall into the corner case exceptions to
     * the "in general" disclaimer.)  However, method {@code reachabilityFence}
     * remains a better option in cases where this approach is not as efficient,
     * desirable, or possible; for example because it would encounter deadlock.
     *
     * @param ref the reference. If {@code null}, this method has no effect.
