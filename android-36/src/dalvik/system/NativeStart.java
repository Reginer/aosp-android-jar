/**
 * Fake class used during JNI initialization.  The JNI functions want
 * to be able to create objects, and the VM needs to discard the references
 * when the function returns.  That gets a little weird when we're
 * calling JNI functions from the C main(), and there's no Java stack frame
 * to hitch the references onto.
 *
 * Rather than having some special-case code, we create this simple little
 * class and pretend that it called the C main().
 *
 * This also comes in handy when a native thread attaches itself with the
 * JNI AttachCurrentThread call.  If they attach the thread and start
 * creating objects, we need a fake frame to store stuff in.
